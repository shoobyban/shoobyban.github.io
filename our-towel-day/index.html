        <p class="card-text"><p>The day before yesterday we had excellent Towel Day. The participants were:</p>
<p>Jul, Szimszon, Bmp, Kecsi and me.</p>
<p>What is Towel Day?</p>
<p>Towel Day has been declared by an internet movement to celebrate Douglas</p>
<p>Adams’ memory, it is set for 25th May. The idea was that people carry</p>
<p>their towel with them everywhere on that day as a tribute to Doulgas Adams.</p>
<p>So carry your towel with you throughout the day, think about Hitchhikers</p>
<p>Guide to the Galaxy and Douglas Adams and spread the word of 42.</p>
<p>A citation from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy about towels:</p>
<p>“A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar</p>
<p>hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value – you can wrap it</p>
<p>around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you</p>
<p>can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V,</p>
<p>inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars</p>
<p>which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini</p>
<p>raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat;</p>
<p>wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of</p>
<p>the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it</p>
<p>assumes that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you – daft as a bush, but</p>
<p>very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal,</p>
<p>and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.</p>
<p>More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason,</p>
<p>if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his</p>
<p>towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession</p>
<p>of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map,</p>
<p>ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these</p>
<p>or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have “lost”.</p>
<p>What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and</p>
<p>breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds,</p>
<p>win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be</p>
<p>reckoned with.”</p>
