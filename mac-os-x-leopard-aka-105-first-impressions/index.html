After a clean install I have moved my programs into the Applications folder, then Application Support, Preferences and many things from my old home folder. After this I had a clean leo with my apps working (or not :))
I had to squash some bugs, too, for example FileMaker works with US locale but nothing else, hot-keys stopped working with international keyboard layouts (for example command-`, move focus to next window) this is really painful.">

<p>I had to download some beta programs instead of stable releases, but it&#8217;s OK.</p>
