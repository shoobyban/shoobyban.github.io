<p>It&#8217;s easy to say the it&#8217;s my fault, but the situation is foggy. At this point I decided to be strong and tell them there is just one way of working together (of course I had to wait the time I don&#8217;t depend their future project promises)&#8230;</p>

<p>So hard time comes, I will have to check all the contracts and see if I will have to fulfil anything like burn the whole project on a CD or write a paper about the stuff.</p>
