<p>Normally I help them as I should, but after a number of requests I start to slow down, losing interest. I know it’s not the best what I can do, but they don’t want to pay my time and although I really like them (not all of them, but in general) I have to do my other jobs, too.</p>
<p>It’s easy to say the it’s my fault, but the situation is foggy. At this point I decided to be strong and tell them there is just one way of working together (of course I had to wait the time I don’t depend their future project promises)…</p>
<p>So hard time comes, I will have to check all the contracts and see if I will have to fulfil anything like burn the whole project on a CD or write a paper about the stuff.</p>
