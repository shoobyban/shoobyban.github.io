<p>I have been invited by Interware Rt. (a five stars server hosting hotel)</p>

<p>with many young (and not so very young) IT professionals and Interware&#8217;s</p>

<p>most important business partners.</p>

<p>For Your Information: The visit in CERN is for FREE. Actually we had the</p>

<p>first group who had asked for guided tour in Hungarian. So they have asked</p>

<p>their Hungarian staff to attend some courses (for few weeks) and become</p>

<p>certified tour guides (they were computer scientists working at the Data</p>

<p>Center) so we were very intimated.</p>

<p>The weather was nice (except some showers) and we had good time at</p>

<p>CERN. We have seen many interesting and exciting things like the first</p>

<p>webserver of the world (as you might know the Web was born at CERN),</p>

<p>very-very big clusters (around 2000 nodes) from Linux machines and beautiful</p>

<p>tape silos. I have many good pictures (from others, too) and some home</p>

<p>made videos (taken by my C-765)!</p>

<p>Our trip was hard (2&#215;16 hours of bus travel was hard for my back, we also had</p>

<p>to sleep in the bus one night) so I will go to bed tomorrow early.</p>

<p>Pictures and videos will be avalilable from</p>
