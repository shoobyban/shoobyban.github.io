      <title>iRecipeBook for iPad</title>

      <description>We have a new release! The iPad compatible iRecipeBook was a request, actually we had a bad review, stating that the – iPhone only – iRecipeBook looks wrong on the iPad… The reviewer stated that five stars will be the award of an iPad compatible release. I’m waiting!
Meanwhile I’m already working on localisations, social networking update (Facebook share, Twitter, Pinterest maybe…) and sharing recipes via email and from within the App.</description>

      <title>Creating Magento admin grid without database tables</title>

      <description>It’s not common that you have to display something that’s not in the Magento database. It was not too difficult to figure out how to do it but checking this might save you few minutes.
Feel free to download the code itself: [Wizguild_VirtualGrid.zip][1]</description>

      <title>TextWrangler PHPTidy filter</title>

      <description>it works with files (reading from file instead of standard input) there is a non-optional argument “command”, as phptidy has lots of features it does not break lines after semicolons  …so I had to tweak the code a little. I hope you will find it useful.
Oh, yes, your download link:
PHPTidy text filter for TextWrangler
For XMLTidy I use this shell script:</description>

      <title>Updated iRecipeBook finally</title>

      <description>It took terribly long to fix the built-in web server. Thank you for your support by using the App and sorry for annoyances. The focus is on social networking features now.
As the database is bigger and bigger, especially after uploading images for every recipe I’ve realized maybe we will have to implement an option to get rid of big images. The big image feature was introduced to help social networking publication, but clearly we can’t sacrifice launch performance.</description>
