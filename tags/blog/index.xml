      <description>I had WordPress for a myriad of years ‚Äì it feels like. As my daily work involves moving clients away to other, less feature rich but more integrated solutions it became more and more pressing to check options for myself.
Hugo is written in Go, a language that I chose to implement several big projects. Accidentally, Hugo became an inspiration and source for documentation when I started to look for good articles about Go&#39;s templating language that we use extensively.</description>

      <title>Go 1.10 party waitlist</title>

      <description>Go 1.10 is not full of new features. But one feature makes me really happy, GOPATH being optional. I will be able to work in my projects folder (my hope, anyway).
I&#39;m a member of the¬†Go London User Group, although I have never managed to either turn up or get in yet. I wander if Gophers are as nice people as my e-commerce peeps.
Oh by the way, I love math.</description>

      <description>Wow, two years without (published) post!
I‚Äôve started to experiment with Go in the meantime. I have to admit I‚Äôm far from being able to write good code in Go, not that I could tell this from any other programming languages, but hey, it‚Äôs something.
As my normal day job involves some backend here and there and we are doing some serious ETL magic, I had to look around for a transformation language.</description>

      <description>This is the time of the year when I do my little stock-taking around my memories about last year.
Mate had a good start in the school with the exception of some innocent violence pushing and kicking others. He has a good grasp of reading, he is using this newly acquired skill with confidence. The school turned out as an excellent choice.
Daniel failed to get good GCSE grades, but we have found a course at East Surrey College for him where he seems to be happy.</description>

      <description>This post is about last year.
I have to say it was really colourful. Lets begin with office matters. This was my second year at the company, we had good year so management decided to go to other markets too. This meant new language to support, having fun with French again, c‚Äôest bon. New colleagues, lots of learning. Good and bad decisions, really good and really bad days too.
At home we have helping hand (au pair) so my loved one Emese has a full time job again.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write a blogpost about MageHack 2012 London (magehack.com) but somehow failed until now. I‚Äôll be brief as it was long ago and the memory is fading fast.
There was a pub warm-up event on the Friday before the event, with beers and schnitzel (a guy grabbed the last one just before me), sausages, mash‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve discussed our plans, trying to find out who will be possible project owner, who will join, and basically who‚Äôs who.</description>

      <description>Looking back on the year, as usual. My memory is so bad I have to take notes üôÇ
If last year was positive, it‚Äôs even better, in every aspects.
I have a nice new job in a small international company as Head of IT / Architect, some kind of a CTO but with lots of fun around the code. We have few Magento systems, building new sites regularly, working with logistics companies and other partners connecting our systems to their, providing them data, sending and updating orders etc.</description>

      <description>Tough DSLRs are not for those who cannot make a steady shot with a pocket cam I decided to buy a D40 after recognising that my pictures are full of noise.
The challenge: to learn to shoot nice photos. I‚Äôve read tutorials, books about the subject, I know the basics, the theory, but this is different.</description>

Update: I have been reviewed by ‚Äúwhoneedsaname‚Äù. It‚Äôs fascinating how the guy writes!</description>

      <description>The new cat gives me so much, I can‚Äôt count everything.
After a clean install I have moved my programs into the Applications folder, then Application Support, Preferences and many things from my old home folder. After this I had a clean leo with my apps working (or not :))
I had to squash some bugs, too, for example FileMaker works with US locale but nothing else, hot-keys stopped working with international keyboard layouts (for example command-`, move focus to next window) this is really painful.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs not official, barely legal (it‚Äôs from an Adium theme) but looks good. To install: get it here and after uncompressing copy it into /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/Resources/ChatStyles/ (or find the according folder on Linux and Windows). You cannot switch the color scheme and can‚Äôt show avatars, but it‚Äôs cute.</description>

      <description>After 2 months of fighting with my pain and inflammation in my lung with aid of drugs like steroids and antibiotics I had to find that after I stopped to get those pills the pain and the inflammation came back.
But it‚Äôs better than poisoning myself with steroids and drugs for blood pressure and so‚Ä¶ after one month of taking Medrol I had terrible headache (I mean terrible and way too long‚Ä¶ 3 weeks long without a minute stop) but it was better after I was able to stop taking it.</description>

      <description>So, after hard times I have another chance to express my ideas and feelings about my environment. I‚Äôve got new server! Wow, wow!
I‚Äôm so happy!
Few words about last months:
 I‚Äôm working at A4 Apple Center as Head of development, we are making financial systems for clients with Mac systems. I‚Äôm quite happy with my squash play. I had to make myself move somehow. Unfortunately BMP has moved back to Bicske so I haven‚Äôt got permanent partner.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I have bought a Nokia 6111. This is a good-looking Series 40 phone (sigh, no more python/c++ hacking, no more iSync)‚Ä¶
While there is a program to sync contacts, etc (works well with 6111) called PhoneDirector from MacMedia, I had to write my own (and free) app to upload the contents of my Address Book to the phone.
Gnokii is a good choice, if you have just one contact to sync but if you have few hundred you will have to make a script.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I brought home the first Mighty mouse for testing. I have to say I was right. This is an evolutionary mouse, but users will have to learn to use it. Clicking with the right, left or the middle (OK, its better to say 1,2,3 or primary etc.) button is easy if you don‚Äôt think just do it. But when you see what you do (for example I lift my other fingers up) you will try to do it other ways and it does not work like that.</description>

      <description>Hard times, again. Hard to find time to stop, I feel something is missing. Maybe some holiday. While checking our schedule, we decided to have a break at next week. This is our last hope. I could just hope this will be OK for my clients and for Emese‚Äôs boss.
The plan is to camp out somewhere near, for example the Aquapark near Mogyorod‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶ sounds relaxing. Although I need some rest, the weather forecasts and state of my projects make me feel bad about the next week‚Ä¶ we will see.</description>

      <description>The European Parliament will have a vote on the issue in September about
software patents. We are in the works to make that little difference by
putting pressure on the Hungarian government to withdraw their support for

the decision to be made seems to be to put some pressure on the officials</description>

      <description>I have been using cvs for ages. Jul is subversion fan, I wanted to try it out,
so I had to install it.
Every time I said ‚Äúfink install svn‚Äù or ‚Äúfink install svn-client-ssl‚Äù I got
frightened from 40 new packages (apache2 and others) so I had to find
something.
So I had to recognise I was blind‚Ä¶ on subversion‚Äôs official site there is a

Towel Day has been declared by an internet movement to celebrate Douglas

their towel with them everywhere on that day as a tribute to Doulgas Adams.
So carry your towel with you throughout the day, think about Hitchhikers</description>
