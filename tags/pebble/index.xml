      <description>I have to say creating beautiful watchfaces is addictive. I had to create a new one, now a replica. I&amp;#8217;ve found a Gucci watch I would love to have â€“ but as a smartwatch. Creating it was fun, having it pure joy. See watchfaces page for details.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve published my latest watchface, ShoMaurice, after using Maurice for a while and missing/disliking few things about it. I can&amp;#8217;t help it. Pebble&amp;#8217;s decision to make C the primary language for developing watchfaces was an excellent choice. Of course you can theoretically make apps in JavaScript but why?
I have other projects as well but I enjoy this, with a few hours of coding I create something beautiful, then I carry it with me.</description>
