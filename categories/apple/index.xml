I&amp;#8217;m still waiting Apple&amp;#8217;s approval of my request to join their developer community. It&amp;#8217;s not straightforward, because I cannot buy anything from Apple Store. I live on the wrong side of the world. I had to fax them papers to prove I will buy the subscription, now they are sitting on this paper and ask me to wait.
It&amp;#8217;s not so easy to wait, after waiting more than one year to release something it&amp;#8217;s more than annoying.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t wait the stable release! After years of watching the splash screen I was delighted to see how fast is the new OOo beta. Service guys has a big XLS price-list of the service parts, this beta software opened this huge file with such an easiness and speed&amp;#8230; I will like the native OOo, I think. NeoOffice is still better if you have to edit something, I had many problems with the fonts and chart sizes, this is normal for a beta software.</description>

      <title>iPhone SDK</title>

      <description>This morning I have finished porting iLines to official SDK. Works well. I have to admit there are drawbacks (lack of Interface Builder, coming soon) but my code was also buggy (I&amp;#8217;m not surprised :))
So now I know I&amp;#8217;ll be able to write software and probably I&amp;#8217;ll do it. Before this Apple will have to release firmware 2.0 and this is the hardest thing to wait for something you can use now (theoretically).</description>
