        <p class="card-text"><p>I had WordPress for a myriad of years – it feels like. As my daily work involves moving clients away to other, less feature rich but more integrated solutions it became more and more pressing to check options for myself.</p>

<p><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>, a language that I chose to implement several big projects. Accidentally, Hugo became an inspiration and source for documentation when I started to look for good articles about <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">Go&rsquo;s templating language</a> that we use extensively. Turned out that Hugo, – relying on the same template parser – have <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/">extensive documentation</a> that I could copy-paste then rewrite (read plagiarize) parts from.</p>

<p>As I already knew the template handling part, it became obvious – actually it was much more nuanced – that I should try Hugo for my blog as well. I was reading an article that was saying something about generating static content and had something about blogs&hellip; it clicked. I did a quick search about static site generators and Hugo came up (again).</p>

<p>After another quick search for <code>WordPress to Hugo</code> I knew I have <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter">options</a>. Funny how the same people come up again and again, <a href="https://github.com/SchumacherFM">Cyrill Schumacher</a> is also an active <a href="https://magento.com/">Magento</a> community member to say the least. Anyway. After exporting the blog content I had a quick glance, making sure I will not lose too much data, everything looked ok.</p>

<p>Appearance is not really important for me but I have certain ideas about how a website should look like. Scrolling through the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo themes</a>, my first bet was on <a href="https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme">Hugo Creative Portfolio Theme</a> but turned out that it was the worst possible starting point. Copied the theme into <code>themes/</code>, my exported content into <code>content/</code>, run <code>hugo server -D</code> (this is how you live-preview your site before generating the static content) and I ended up with an empty site.</p>

<p>Being curious and stubborn help a lot, checked the files again, found out that post URLs work, <code>/posts/</code> as well, so it must be something around the index page. Well, index page had no template. Must be something about how you are supposed to set up the site, I thought, so I created a <code>content/posts/_index.md</code> with this content:</p>

<pre><code>---
url: &quot;/&quot;
---
</code></pre>

<p>To my surprise the site started to behave well. Few tweaks here and there, and I decided to generate the static content. Running <code>hugo</code> did that, created a <code>public/</code> folder with my files, <code>index.html</code> and many others. My next rush of adrenaline and serotonin was wasted. The <code>index.html</code> turned out to be empty, so Hugo didn&rsquo;t like my above hack. Trying to find some other way in the documentation was a futile attempt, I&rsquo;m not really good at reading through documentation for clues – impatience? Of course no one else had this problem before!</p>

<p>After probably 30 minutes of embarrassing search - reading docs - reading template files - modifying template files I arrived to a point that I felt I&rsquo;ll need help. As Hugo is in go, <a href="https://gophers.slack.com/">Gophers Slack</a> was my next logical step. Quickly joined <code>#hugo</code> and did a feeble attempt to explain my worries.
Waiting for my answer made me realise that I &ldquo;stood up and walked away&rdquo;, created space for new ideas, my favourite way of solving problems. The new idea was to check other templates, how their <code>index.html</code> template look like. Gotcha!</p>

<p>Downloaded <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-primer/">Hugo Primer</a>, removed my hack, checked the site, everything worked off the shelves, as it was written. Lovely! Embarrassing &ldquo;Never mind, it was the template&rdquo; to the Slack channel before anybody could pick up the problem. Of course Hugo Primer was not really my style, but now I was on the right track. <a href="https://github.com/dim0627/hugo_theme_beg">Beg</a> was my final choice, after removing few unnecessary parts from the html theme files I was quite happy with my attempt.</p>

<p>Adding menu items were a bit easier, Hugo documentation is good, in minutes I had all the right pages in the menu, by editing the content files and adding <code>menu: main</code> to their header.</p>

<p>Generated site looked fab, quick <code>scp</code> to the server, making backup of the WordPress folder (safety first), extracting the contents, et voila! Shiny new lightning fast blog!</p>
