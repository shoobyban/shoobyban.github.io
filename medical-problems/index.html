<p>But it&#8217;s better than poisoning myself with steroids and drugs for blood pressure and so&#8230; after one month of taking Medrol I had terrible headache (I mean terrible and way too long&#8230; 3 weeks long without a minute stop) but it was better after I was able to stop taking it. Maybe it was because the Medrol, maybe not.</p>

<p>I could just hope I will recover fast&#8230; OK or at least recover anyway, I know lung and pleurisy is not the fast healing kind stuff. Doctors found still no reason&#8230; it&#8217;s scaring me a bit, of course.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working from home and trying to move less and stay in bed&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard because it causes pain sometimes, so I have to sit up or stand up then try to find a better position. Even big breath-takings are bad. It&#8217;s so annoying&#8230;</p>
