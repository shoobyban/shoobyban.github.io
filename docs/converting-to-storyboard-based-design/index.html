  <div class="article-body"><p>As Apple is pushing Storyboard based app development I&#8217;ve decided to give it a go. Having a family holiday with lots of spare time after the pools closed I&#8217;ve started to pull it together for iRecipeBook.</p>

<p>I had to find out how to simplify and standardise my old – I mean really old – code that I call guano code, created layer-by-layer as technology changed and requests came. Mostly it was about delegates, callbacks and properties – duplicated here and there, non-standard solutions for supporting of older (iOS 4.x) systems.</p>

<p>As new technologies like iCloud will be essential and I can&#8217;t support 4.x any more I was able to greatly simplify the business logic. In just about a week (mostly from 9pm to whenever I fainted from exhaustion) I&#8217;ve learnt Storyboard and made the iPhone and iPad version, pulled it to the feature level of the original.</p>

<p>To be honest it is a great relief to have something up-to-date, with iOS 7 coming I have to be up-to-date and my solutions have to be closer to the standard solutions.</p>

<p>Of course I&#8217;m testing the app with iOS 7 and &#8230; I have to resize few views as they go under the top navigation bar, for example. Puzzling.</p>

<p>Also some design change is unavoidable. Finding the balance between the two designs will be an interesting challenge.</p>
