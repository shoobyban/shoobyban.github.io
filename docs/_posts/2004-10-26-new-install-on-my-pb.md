I had to reinstall my system after more than a year of stability. I think I will have to
  
avoid installing third party programs and system extensions. I could just
  
hope my backup was complete ðŸ™‚

After the reinstall I had 35 gigs of space, holy hard drive! OK, OK. After
  
installing the most necessary programs and my backup data I have just 20
  
gigs of 40, but it&#8217;s kind of interesting how many rubbish I used to store.

Will this be a serious event? Will I have to reinstall my systemÂ periodically to get rid
  
of the mess?
