OK, so it&#8217;s time for review last year. I&#8217;m happy it&#8217;s over. I hope I will like 2006 better.

  * **Projects:** 
      * Two major Flash-MySQL-perl based TV show game (currently in use on ATV and Duna TV)
      * Web sites (kepvadasz.hu, A4 Apple Center, &#8230;)
      * Call Center application in Cocoa, Webkit, PHP and MySQL
      * OpenOffice.org 2.0 Hungarian version with Hunspell for Mac OS X, aka FSF.hu build
      * contribution in TV show called Macians (currently I feel shame because I have no time) on [Fix.tv][1]
      * started to work on other smaller projects with various new customers
  * **Job:** From 1st of August I have new job: I&#8217;m development director of A4 Apple Center, first real Apple Center in Hungary. My tasks are project management, software development in C, Objective-C, Perl, PHP&#8230; etc, Unix support (mostly Linux, *BSD and Mac OS X server systems) and systems analysis.
  * **Education:** Oh, almost forget. I have MSC. In February I have finished my diploma work and made final exams on [ELTE][2]. My major is Teacher of Computer Sciences. This was my second diploma, I&#8217;m quite happy with it.
  * **Conferences:** Attended Apple Expo in September, Paris, I gave a speech about [Gimp][3] at Linux in Education Conference and about free software development at Software Freedom Day, Szeged. I have given speeches about free software on [our][4] road-show stops, too.
  * **Games:** finally I have found a game to play: WoW (World of Warcraft). You will find me at Ragnaros realm, in Alliance guild called Elemental Gankery. My main character&#8217;s name is Dorthum.
  * **Private:** mostly WoW (see: Games), my sister Gabi has married in August, I live happy family life with Emese. It was our 6th year together.
  * **Politics:** still nothing. I still hate politics, I think I will continue it this year&#8230;
  * **Health:** no luck.
  * **Love:** see Private. I&#8217;m happy.
  * **Money:** see Job. I&#8217;m quite happy&#8230; sort of.
  * **Free/spare time:** see Job, Private and Games. I haven&#8217;t got too much time to play, for other things like sports and parties&#8230; forget it.

Bah. So this was 2005. I have processed few thousand e-mails, about the same amount of web pages, I have made few good applications and I have survived this year.
