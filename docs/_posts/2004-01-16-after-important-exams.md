I like it! I have some time today to write a blog entry about my exams and
  
other things. I did my exams well (I have written a graphics and an applied
  
informatics exam last week, a numeric recipes exam yesterday), I will have
  
to make a homework about didactics and I will have a programming languages
  
exam next week, too. Then two more semesters and I got my MSC!
