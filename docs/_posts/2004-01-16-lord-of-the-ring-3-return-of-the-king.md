OK, yesterday evening I managed to collect my friends and buy tickets for
  
LOTR3. I enjoyed it, the film had outstanding visual effects &#8211; except the
  
hobbits&#8230; The bluebox stuff was lame and badly lighted. The storyline was
  
well made, not much quake-like bloodbath&#8230; I think the giant spider was a
  
bit too scarry. The end was long, but they left out the last boring events
  
from the book, so it was a bit hollywood-kind end (family, kids, happy wife
  
:))

It was too long, 3 hours and 10 or 20 minutes&#8230; My legs was numbed, I don&#8217;t
  
like sitting much like that.

Eight from ten.
