Hard times, again. Hard to find time to stop, I feel something is missing. Maybe some holiday. While checking our schedule, we decided to have a break at next week. This is our last hope. I could just hope this will be OK for my clients and for Emese&#8217;s boss.

The plan is to camp out somewhere near, for example the Aquapark near Mogyorod&#8230; hmm&#8230; sounds relaxing. Although I need some rest, the weather forecasts and state of my projects make me feel bad about the next week&#8230; we will see.
