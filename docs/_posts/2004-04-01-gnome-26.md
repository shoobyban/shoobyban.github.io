[Gnome 2.6][1] is out! I feel shame, I had no commits since the last release. I
  
will have to check GKB and Glines if they were working&#8230; It&#8217;s hard to use a
  
PC&#8230;

I have found the missing key tab file for my ill-fated gkeycaps program, I
  
will try to continue the coding&#8230; I have forgot to commit it into the Gnome
  
CVS and the program does not work without this file ðŸ˜›

The file is on my iPod, but I left my iPod at the customer. How fool I am!

Update: I have commited the file&#8230;
