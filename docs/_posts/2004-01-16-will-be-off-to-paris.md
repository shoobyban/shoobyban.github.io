Tomorrow evening we will visit Sebastien
  
(this is a picture, his website is down) in Paris.

This is the first time Maji will join to us, he will be a bit unhappy with the other people speaking foreign languages and no Hungarian. He can understand some basic words and expressions like &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221;, &#8220;OK&#8221;, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go&#8221; in English but nothing in French.
  
We will show him the city, I&#8217;m sure he will enjoy the trip.

Last night he got sick, had fever and now he&#8217;s sleeping (in front of the PS2 with paused Ratchet & Clunk), I hope he will feel better tomorrow.
