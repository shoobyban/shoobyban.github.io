We will make a new event at A4 Apple Center (Andrassy street 4, Budapest) at Friday, Jun 30 about Mac OS X Server operating system and people around servers, read: system administrators.

My friends (who are exceptional professionals super pro-gurus) will be there, if you have questions or want to meet someone (for example me) please come. I mean you are welcome.

We will talk about servers, new technologies around Macs, free software projects, development, ideas, etc.
