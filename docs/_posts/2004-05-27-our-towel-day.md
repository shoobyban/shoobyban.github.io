The day before yesterday we had excellent Towel Day. The participants were:
  
Jul, Szimszon, Bmp, Kecsi and me.

What is Towel Day?

Towel Day has been declared by an internet movement to celebrate Douglas
  
Adams&#8217; memory, it is set for 25th May. The idea was that people carry
  
their towel with them everywhere on that day as a tribute to Doulgas Adams.

So carry your towel with you throughout the day, think about Hitchhikers
  
Guide to the Galaxy and Douglas Adams and spread the word of 42.

A citation from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy about towels:

&#8220;A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar
  
hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value &#8211; you can wrap it
  
around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you
  
can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V,
  
inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars
  
which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini
  
raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat;
  
wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of
  
the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it
  
assumes that if you can&#8217;t see it, it can&#8217;t see you &#8211; daft as a bush, but
  
very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal,
  
and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
  
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason,
  
if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his
  
towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession
  
of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map,
  
ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc.
  
Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these
  
or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have &#8220;lost&#8221;.
  
What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and
  
breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds,
  
win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be
  
reckoned with.&#8221;
