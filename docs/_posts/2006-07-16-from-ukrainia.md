Beregszasz (Beregovo), Ukraine, Dormitory of Transcarpatian Hungarian College Named After Ferenc Rakoczi II&#8230; tomorrow we will give speeches on free software for teachers.

I&#8217;m sitting in front of my machine, after a long trip. We had a meeting in Nyiregyhaza with the others and some pizza then in a 5 cars long convoy we started to annoy the border guards ðŸ™‚ It was a dumb situation when the Ukrainian border guard asked us (of course in Ukrainian language) about why we are waiting in a forbidden area. I tried to explain we are in convoy and we are waiting to others but she did not speak any language we did, so no luck. This was after the nearly half hour process of filling silly papers (immigration card, LOL)&#8230; Brr&#8230; We have seen writings about getting out of cars are forbidden, so we were scared a bit ðŸ™‚

OK, so we are here, on the way to the restaurant we met Ukrainian young people telling us Hungarian dirty phrases about us, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s safe to speak Hungarian here&#8230;

The hosts and Hungarian people are nice, the dorm room is OK, I have power (after finding out where to find safe connectors, for example a fridge&#8217;s one).

The weather is &#8230; well it&#8217;s everything but not nice. At Budapest we had sunshine and hot summer. We did not prepare with warm clothes, so we will have to buy some if the rain will not stop soon&#8230;

Back to the wine&#8230;
