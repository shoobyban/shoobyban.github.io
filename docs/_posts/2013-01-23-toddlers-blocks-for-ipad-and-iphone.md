Finally I&#8217;ve released my [block-building game][1] for the kids! They&#8217;ve been testing it on the iPad for ages, asking for more faces, telling me that they like this, don&#8217;t like that etc.

Of course for App Store screen-shots I had to modify the UI, for loading and saving block layouts, it&#8217;s hard to create the same screen-shots for all the resolutions&#8230; and left a broken callback in the code even after testing, so 1.0 has a bug that you click on the menu and click again, boom, it crashes. I&#8217;m not really happy about it, but nobody is prefect&#8230;

Fix is already waiting for review, I hope I will be lucky to have it reviewed very soon.
