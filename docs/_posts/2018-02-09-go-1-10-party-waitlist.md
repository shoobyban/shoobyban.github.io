Go 1.10 is not full of new features. But one feature makes me really happy, GOPATH being optional. I will be able to work in my projects folder (my hope, anyway).

I'm a member of the [Go London User Group][1], although I have never managed to either turn up or get in yet. I wander if Gophers are as nice people as my e-commerce peeps.

Oh by the way, I love [math.Round()][2] and warmly welcome the compilation caching, just for the record.
