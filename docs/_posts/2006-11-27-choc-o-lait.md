This weekend we had nice weather at Heviz. I can&#8217;t remember the last time when we were so happy and relaxed. Heviz is Hungary&#8217;s most famous thermal lake, beautiful (with water lily) and radioactive water. I have no problem with my bones or muscles (the water is good for disabled people) but we had an invitation for 3 days.
  
The weather was so warm I walked on the street in t-shirt. The water was fine, people were nice, we&#8217;ve spent a fortune on food ðŸ™‚
  
I&#8217;ve found a great product called [choc-o-lait][1] in a restaurant: this is a hot chocolate from Belgian chocolate. The product contains a cube of chocolate on a stick. Put the stuff in hot milk and stir it. This is a great idea and the taste&#8230; uh&#8230; hard to describe.
  
The place where we stayed was [Fortuna PanziÃ³][2] , a pension with good looking and silent rooms, the staff is helpful and friendly.
