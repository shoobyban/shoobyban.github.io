I&#8217;m folding proteins on my locked screen (I normally do not use any
  
screensaver but screen locks)&#8230; Few days ago I have found (again) a protein
  
folding project, called [Folding@Home.][1]

The goal of the project is understand how to fold proteins and protein
  
aggregation, helping to fight Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s disease, Mad Cow
  
(BSE), CJD and ALS&#8230; I love to help, so I have downloaded the GUI and the
  
screensaver and joined to Team Mac OS X.

I have a big problem with the screen saver. I don&#8217;t want to throw out my
  
display after a few months. The screensaver has advertisements on the bottom
  
of the screen, they will probably burn into the screen.

I hate this kind of usability problems. Are they thinking or just pretending
  
to?

Terrible!
