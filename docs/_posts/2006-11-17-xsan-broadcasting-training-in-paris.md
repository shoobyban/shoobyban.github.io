Finally I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;ve played with Xserves, Xserve RAIDs and fibre channel switches in the last few days, it was fun. French people are nice, the host of the training is a company is Agnosys.fr, a French Apple training company. They have good trainings as I understand their brochures. I&#8217;ve learnt few new French words too and many about Apple video editing and server solutions. I love to be here ðŸ™‚
