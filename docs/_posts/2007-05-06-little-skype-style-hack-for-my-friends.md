It&#8217;s not official, barely legal (it&#8217;s from an Adium theme) but looks good. To install: get it here and after uncompressing copy it into /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/Resources/ChatStyles/ (or find the according folder on Linux and Windows). You cannot switch the color scheme and can&#8217;t show avatars, but it&#8217;s cute.
