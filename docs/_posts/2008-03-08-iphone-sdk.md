This morning I have finished porting iLines to official SDK. Works well. I have to admit there are drawbacks (lack of Interface Builder, coming soon) but my code was also buggy (I&#8217;m not surprised :))

So now I know I&#8217;ll be able to write software and probably I&#8217;ll do it. Before this Apple will have to release firmware 2.0 and this is the hardest thing to wait for something you can use now (theoretically). I&#8217;m glad and sad. Very.
