We have a new release! The iPad compatible iRecipeBook was a request, actually we had a bad review, stating that the – iPhone only – iRecipeBook looks wrong on the iPad&#8230; The reviewer stated that five stars will be the award of an iPad compatible release. I&#8217;m waiting!

Meanwhile I&#8217;m already working on localisations, social networking update (Facebook share, Twitter, Pinterest maybe&#8230;) and sharing recipes via email and from within the App.
