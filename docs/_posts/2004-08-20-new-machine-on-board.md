After long delay (waiting for service, about 3 weeks or more) few days ago
  
(ok, I know, I&#8217;m a bad blogger) I got my first dual processor system.
  
Reeeealy cute!!! A real PowerMac G4 (Gigabit Ethernet model) with two 450
  
MHz CPU, RAM and some other parts cannibalised from another systems. Yes, the seller have changed the hard drive to a noisy 20 gig one, my first step was to
  
change it to a silent drive&#8230;

I&#8217;m impressed with the speed. Ok, I know, this is an old machine, but
  
really. I really like this machine!

Yesterday I had an ill-fated try to build a NeoOffice (from Jaguar&#8230;
  
brrr&#8230; hard to switch back from Panther), it has problems with some VLC
  
(not the video player, I suppose) includes, tomorrow or later I will give it
  
another try. I&#8217;m too sick to fight with build environments.
