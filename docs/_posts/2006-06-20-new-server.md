So, after hard times I have another chance to express my ideas and feelings about my environment. I&#8217;ve got new server! Wow, wow!

I&#8217;m so happy!

Few words about last months:

  * I&#8217;m working at A4 Apple Center as Head of development, we are making financial systems for clients with Mac systems.
  * I&#8217;m quite happy with my squash play. I had to make myself move somehow. Unfortunately BMP has moved back to Bicske so I haven&#8217;t got permanent partner.
  * I have free software projects again. Exciting! Details later.
  * Have you seen Google SketchUp? It&#8217;s kinda cool!
  * In World of Warcraft I have a level 60 druid, collecting golds for epic mount ðŸ™‚ But have no time to play ðŸ˜›
