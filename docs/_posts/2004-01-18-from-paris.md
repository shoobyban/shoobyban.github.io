Here we are, Sebastien&#8217;s place&#8230; changed a lot&#8230; new furnitures, washing
  
machine&#8230;
  
Cool. Today we will try to visit some museums and the Eiffel tower, the
  
weather is cold but nice.
  
Today morning I managed to buy some bread and Coke, in French. I&#8217;m proud of
  
myself ðŸ™‚
