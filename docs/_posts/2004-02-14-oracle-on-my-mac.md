Last week I installed Oracle 9.2 to my PowerBook. I have still problems
  
setting it up in changing network environment (I have to reedit /etc/hosts
  
every time I got new IP address) but runs well on my little book. I had to
  
make an oracle user, with sudo rights&#8230; The tomcat setup has changed
  
between jaguar and panther, so I had to edit some scripts (allup.sh and
  
alldown.sh) to make it run properly.
