    My first year in the UK.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have had great time at the NSI, I have created the newÂ <a href="http://www.patrolstore.com/">patrolstore.com</a> based on Magento, a small site calledÂ <a href="http://www.apace.org.uk/">apace.org.uk</a> for police chiefs using Zend Frameworks, 3 other sites are under testing, a new mail server and lots of small achievements. I have a new nick: they call me &#8220;the Hungarian wizard&#8221; ðŸ™‚

    We live here in Redhill, just south of London in a nice little two bedroom rent. London shops are just 30 minutes with train, Reigate is beautiful small town in walking distance, we love Priory Park! Just check my Picasa album for pictures.

    So about this year: New friends, new skills, lots of fun with my family. This was absolutely a positive year for me, I hope your year was at least as good as mine.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Happy new year!
