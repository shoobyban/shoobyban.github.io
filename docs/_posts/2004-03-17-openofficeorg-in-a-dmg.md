Yes, I have found the way of doing an OpenOffice.org package, with
  
just-mount-and-drag-and-drop install. I have still difficulties with the
  
user directory and the X11 presence, but I will solve it. I had promising meeting with the HDSys (the Hungarian apple distributor), after testing and bugfixes they will probably bundle it for Central European languages.

I have the Hungarian version already working on my desktop ðŸ™‚

My next project is to make a Hungarian, tested version of NeoOffice/J, but
  
OpenOffice.org cvs is dying with an ugly assertion while checking out
  
OOO\_STABLE\_1_PORTS branch. It&#8217;s so annoying!
