I will be one of the hosts in i+ (pronounced: Allj meg, means &#8220;stop&#8221;), a new tv
  
show in fix.tv. The show will show Mac vs. PC fight from one aspect.
  
And old iMac (base G4 with some extra ram) versus an AMD 2GHz monster. Uh.

This will be a hard fight. We will try to introduce Macintosh for the
  
public. Fix.tv is a small tv
  
channel about interactive multimedia and computing, music clips and cars,
  
sports. I will try to not spoil the party, but I don&#8217;t like circus. 😛
