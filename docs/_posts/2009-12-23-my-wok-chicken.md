  * 1 chicken breast
  * 2 table spoon of olive oil
  * 1 can of mushroom
  * 1-2 carrot
  * 1 table spoon of wok spice (contains salt, sugar, garlic, pepper, soy sauce, ginger, fenugreek, turmeric)&#8230; I know this is cheating ðŸ˜‰
  * soy sauce
  * 1 table spoon of starch
  * 1 medium sized onion
  * 100g of rice noodle
  * water

Clean and slice the chicken to 2&#215;3 cm slices, fry them in olive oil till they are white. Peel and slice the carrot to half inch slices, coarsely chop onion and put them in. Wash the mushroom, put it into the pan, pour in the spices, some soy sauce and the starch on it. Stir it, pour water on it to just cover the meat. Place the rice noodle on the top and cover it to boil until noodle is tender enough to stir it together. Pour some more water on the whole, cover it and repeat this until the noodle is ready with some luck.
