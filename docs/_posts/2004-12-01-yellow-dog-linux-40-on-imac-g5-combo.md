I&#8217;m happy with my new iMac G5, it&#8217;s fast, beautiful&#8230; but. I cannot install
  
(without hacking) YDL on it, because YDL 4.0 installer does not recognise
  
its combo drive. Is this serious? üôÅ I will check it again soon but I have
  
no time for hacking a new install set&#8230; I will have to find another ppc
  
distro.

(Update: I have successfully installed YDL 4.0.1)
