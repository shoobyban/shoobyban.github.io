So this will be a bad change ðŸ™‚
  
I tried to change my old tr/td based blog design to blosxom.php kind div/css
  
based.

I hope this will be future-aware, I had to work with this for long hours&#8230;
  
ðŸ™‚
  
If you have an idea about how to position the navi div to not to collide with the
  
main div at bigger font sizes&#8230; Yes, there is font size relative sizing
  
too&#8230; please send me the complete bug-fixed css
  
ðŸ™‚

I had some time, but this is enough, back to work.
