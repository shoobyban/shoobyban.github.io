Easy way to create a new certificate instead of the autogenerated one which comes with &#8220;apt-get install courier-imap-ssl&#8221;:

  * check your /etc/courier/imapd.cnf
  * move the file /etc/courier/imapd.pem to another name or location
  * dpkg-reconfigure courier-imap-ssl
  * restart imapd and check if everything was ok
