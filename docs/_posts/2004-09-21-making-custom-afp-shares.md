I hate to make temporary users and set passwords. I have made a small shell
  
script to help me making custom AFP shares. How to use it (from Terminal):

$ mkafpshare.sh sharename /path/of/directory/to/share

You will have to type in an administrator password (script uses sudo), then
  
turn off and on Personal File Sharing in System Preferences/Sharing.

When you are connecting to your mac from another mac, choose guest, and
  
voilÃ , new share ðŸ™‚

Feel free to use it, but do not send me samba and ftp share making scripts,
  
you will find it easy to do ðŸ™‚
