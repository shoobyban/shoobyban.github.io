Thank you for your support by using the App and sorry for annoyances. The focus is on social networking features now.
  
As the database is bigger and bigger, especially after uploading images for every recipe I&#8217;ve realized maybe we will have to implement an option to get rid of big images. The big image feature was introduced to help social networking publication, but clearly we can&#8217;t sacrifice launch performance. So next update should include a settings switch for big images.
  
I was also thinking of creating a Gallery inside iPhone&#8217;s Gallery App for storing original images instead of resized PNGs.
  
Speaking of PNG, I&#8217;m not 100% sure it was a good choice for thumbnail and especially for big images as format.
  
It would be nice to have your input on any of these issues, feel free to comment or leave a feedback on the [app&#8217;s site][1].
