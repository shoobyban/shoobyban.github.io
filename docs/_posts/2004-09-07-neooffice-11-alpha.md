Oh yes! It&#8217;s incredible! I have NeoOffice based on OpenOffice 1.1 code,
  
thanks to Patrik. [Direct link to the news entry][1]. Knows Hungarian umlaut
  
characters, faster, able to save PDF, etc&#8230;

By the way, I managed to make the Hungarian spell checker and hyphenation
  
work&#8230; At home I will try to build my own Hungarian version, too!
