I can&#8217;t help it. Pebble&#8217;s decision to make C the primary language for developing watchfaces was an excellent choice. Of course you can theoretically make apps in JavaScript but why?

I have other projects as well but I enjoy this, with a few hours of coding I create something beautiful, then I carry it with me.
