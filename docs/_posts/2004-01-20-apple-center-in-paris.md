After some calculations I&#8217;ve decided to buy new battery for my Powerbook here.
  
I will have problems with warranty but the price was cheaper (around 35
  
Euros). It&#8217;s hard to find an Apple shop!
  
I checked apple.fr for the list of resellers, then I met with different
  
shops:

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    They don&#8217;t sell Apple parts but complete computers
  </li>
  <li>
    They don&#8217;t have stock
  </li>
  <li>
    The given address is a warehouse (or something with a big steel door)
  </li>
  <li>
    &#8230; and of course there are others who sell Apple parts ðŸ™‚
  </li>
</ol>

We&#8217;ve had some problem with France Telecom (their phone boxes are not properly
  
working every time) but Sebastien solved the problem.

So I managed to buy the battery so now I&#8217;m happy but I have to wait for Emese
  
to finish her work on my PB ðŸ™‚ Unfortunately they don&#8217;t have iLife &#8217;04 here,
  
they said &#8220;some days later&#8221;. Tomorrow I will leave Paris, so it&#8217;s not a
  
deal.
