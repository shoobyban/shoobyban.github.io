Rewriting software is good. Code katas are good. Painful but good. Implementing the PIM on one platform and reimplementing it on a different one is especially painful.

Implementing API instead of direct database connection feels nice though.

As well as having an established framework like Symfony2. I had no real problem with the other one but when I will have to support it longer than the support will be available for the framework, sounds like a good idea to just switch â€“ and learn everything again.

Green field projects ðŸ™‚

We are already using this little &#8220;Product Information Management system&#8221; in &#8220;production&#8221;, saving lots of time translating and correcting product names and descriptions.

And that is the previous version. This will be ready soon and it will be even better!
