HDD of my little powerbook is living it&#8217;s last hours. I&#8217;m running the system
  
from my iPod because the harddrive gives terrible noises&#8230; I wonder if it
  
will serve me more than days before the final stop. I will miss my data so
  
bad&#8230;

(Update: in may my harddrive made its last moves&#8230; RIP, old drive)
