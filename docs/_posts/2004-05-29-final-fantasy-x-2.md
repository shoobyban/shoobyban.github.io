At last, I managed to buy a FFX-2. Unfortunately, the seller did not tell me
  
it&#8217;s a German version. We are fighting with the game. I mean I&#8217;m fighting with the
  
German language menus, I have &#8220;difficulties&#8221; with German. So I will try to
  
find the way to exchange it to an English version. The game is fantastic, but the
  
new combat mechanism (aktivemodus, brrr) is too fast for me. I like to
  
meditate on the next turn. We did not figure out how to turn it off, yet.

Has anybody an English version for a German one (for Playstation 2)? Please!
