I&#8217;m sitting in a small but nice place called Café Créme just on the corner, near to our flat. The sandwich was fine (with chorizo), Emese had a melange (she said it was much more like melange compared to the others she had) and we are both using our own WiFi network from home, working and surfing&#8230; It&#8217;s a beautiful day, good start.
