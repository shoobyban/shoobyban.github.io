As of today, we still have 4.x systems running, iOS 5 is still not real minority, so I can&#8217;t just use iOS 6 API.

After reading several articles and trying every framework and sample code I could find my verdict is the same, iOS is not ready for Core Data iCloud yet. The currently available iOS versions are not behaving the same way so either it&#8217;s a testing nightmare or just a nightmare, developers can choose.
  
The only solution I could think of to switch to document based application, but with that I would lose the key features I like in Core Data.

Comments and hints are welcome as always.
