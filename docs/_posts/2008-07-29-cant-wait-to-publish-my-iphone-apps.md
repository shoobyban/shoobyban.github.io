I&#8217;m still waiting Apple&#8217;s approval of my request to join their developer community. It&#8217;s not straightforward, because I cannot buy anything from Apple Store. I live on the wrong side of the world. I had to fax them papers to prove I will buy the subscription, now they are sitting on this paper and ask me to wait.

It&#8217;s not so easy to wait, after waiting more than one year to release something it&#8217;s more than annoying. I am curious when will they decide. Hopefully not before my patience&#8230; never mind, I&#8217;m patient.

So the rules are clear: if you live in a rich country, you can be developer. If not, you are a loser.  Apple doesn&#8217;t even want your money. Funny, isn&#8217;t it? No. It&#8217;s sad.
