The European Parliament will have a vote on the issue in September about
  
software patents. We are in the works to make that little difference by
  
putting pressure on the Hungarian government to withdraw their support for
  
the current draft.

We plan a demonstration and talks. Our last &#8211; and only &#8211; chance to influence
  
the decision to be made seems to be to put some pressure on the officials
  
involved by means of a demonstration, similar to what has happened in
  
Brussels or in Vienna.

If you are against software patents, please join us! (updates will be
  
available)

Update: The demonstration will be held at 15:30-17:00, 24th august, 2004, in
  
the front of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Budapest.

If you are undecided, please check for information on
  
<http://swpat.ffii.org/>
  
or [Wikipedia][1] a bit.

Terrible times come for developers&#8230;

Software patents are BAD! Punish our creativity some other way!
