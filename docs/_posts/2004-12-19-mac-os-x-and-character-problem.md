After replying the umpteen e-mail about Hungarian language specific (latin2)
  
천 and 청 character problem I have made a FAQ page. I describe how to solve the problem when Word and NeoOffice does not see the 천 and 청 characters in a document comes from Windows. It&#8217;s basically a problem specific documentation for FontBook, Apple&#8217;s most important but not-so-well-known application.

(Update: Will have to find the document to correct the links)
