I have been using cvs for ages. Jul is subversion fan, I wanted to try it out,
  
so I had to install it.

Every time I said &#8220;fink install svn&#8221; or &#8220;fink install svn-client-ssl&#8221; I got
  
frightened from 40 new packages (apache2 and others) so I had to find
  
something.

So I had to recognise I was blind&#8230; on [subversion&#8217;s official site][1] there is a
  
link to an [easy installing dmg][2]&#8230; shame on me, again ðŸ™‚

I don&#8217;t bother if the file list of the package is a mile long, but I have a
  
WORKING svn client, at last ðŸ™‚
