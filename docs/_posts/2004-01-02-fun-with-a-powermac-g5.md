I borrowed a PowerMac G5 form HAndras, I met him first on a MUG meeting where
  
I saw his G5 (A clip from HAndras)

He managed to sell his &#8220;old&#8221; 1.6 GHz model and to buy a new one, a freaking
  
dual 2GHz G5. While the old one is waiting for the new owner HAndras was so
  
kind he gave it to me to compile the OpenOffice.org.

I am so happy! I have already a new build, the CVS tarball from Pavel built
  
in about 9 hours. On my PB12 this was about two days&#8230;

I also managed to build the OpenOffice.org with the Hungarian patches, with
  
MySpell. I&#8217;ve got small problems with the spell checker, but I think the
  
main part of the work is complete.

After testing the packages will be available from ftp.fsf.hu.

While using the G5 I have to say it&#8217;s the best workstation machine I ever
  
worked on. I will have to buy one!
