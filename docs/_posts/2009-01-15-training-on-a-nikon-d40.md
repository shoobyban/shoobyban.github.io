Tough DSLRs are not for those who cannot make a steady shot with a pocket cam I decided to buy a D40 after recognising that my pictures are full of noise.

The challenge: to learn to shoot nice photos. I&#8217;ve read tutorials, books about the subject, I know the basics, the theory, but this is different.
