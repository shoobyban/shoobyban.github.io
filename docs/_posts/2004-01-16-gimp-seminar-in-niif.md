Last week I held a seminar about GIMP, within the confines of IPSZILON
  
project by [NIIF][1]. There were a live stream and there will be an archive
  
some day later.

I had to cut half my planned presentation, because the audience had no idea
  
about picture formats, colours and other fundamentals, but I think
  
they were happy with those nifty tricks after the killing theories.
