      <description>I had WordPress for a myriad of years – it feels like. As my daily work involves moving clients away to other, less feature rich but more integrated solutions it became more and more pressing to check options for myself.
Hugo is written in Go, a language that I chose to implement several big projects. Accidentally, Hugo became an inspiration and source for documentation when I started to look for good articles about Go&#39;s templating language that we use extensively.</description>

      <title>New tool: gwget, wget based on file list, downloading only missing files</title>

      <description>I had to pull only missing images from media folder of live to a staging server. Best way to do it was to … create a tool that does exactly what I had to do.
http://github.com/shoobyban/gwget is the result. Enjoy.

      <description>Go 1.10 is not full of new features. But one feature makes me really happy, GOPATH being optional. I will be able to work in my projects folder (my hope, anyway).
I&#39;m a member of the Go London User Group, although I have never managed to either turn up or get in yet. I wander if Gophers are as nice people as my e-commerce peeps.
Oh by the way, I love math.</description>

      <description>Wow, two years without (published) post!
I’ve started to experiment with Go in the meantime. I have to admit I’m far from being able to write good code in Go, not that I could tell this from any other programming languages, but hey, it’s something.
As my normal day job involves some backend here and there and we are doing some serious ETL magic, I had to look around for a transformation language.</description>

      <description>I have to say creating beautiful watchfaces is addictive. I had to create a new one, now a replica. I’ve found a Gucci watch I would love to have – but as a smartwatch. Creating it was fun, having it pure joy. See watchfaces page for details.</description>

      <description>I’ve published my latest watchface, ShoMaurice, after using Maurice for a while and missing/disliking few things about it. I can’t help it. Pebble’s decision to make C the primary language for developing watchfaces was an excellent choice. Of course you can theoretically make apps in JavaScript but why?
I have other projects as well but I enjoy this, with a few hours of coding I create something beautiful, then I carry it with me.</description>

      <description>Pebble smartwatch projects ShoOne A simple watchface ShoOne watchface for Pebble Smartwatch.

This watchface is tailored to my taste. Analog watch with no second handle, rounded and distinguishable minute and hour handles, day of the week, day of the month, bluetooth connection vibration alert and display, battery and battery percentage, digital time display on the bottom, 3 and 9 o’clock digits for readability, so everything I need. Probably everything you will need and like.</description>

      <description>Rewriting software is good. Code katas are good. Painful but good. Implementing the PIM on one platform and reimplementing it on a different one is especially painful.
Implementing API instead of direct database connection feels nice though.
As well as having an established framework like Symfony2. I had no real problem with the other one but when I will have to support it longer than the support will be available for the framework, sounds like a good idea to just switch – and learn everything again.</description>

      <description>In the past few weeks I have been working on the PIM (Product Management System) for my Magento instance. With the current setup we can work on the products without having to touch Magento admin.
Product data is versioned and synchronised both ways on every PIM product list display – this is not optimal but works well, I will probably create a cron job.
Attributes and attribute sets are also synchronised, CRUD is ready but I don’t want to show it on the frontend.</description>

      <title>Simple Product Information Management system for Magento</title>

      <description>Product Information Management systems help you to manage product information centrally. In a sense Magento is a PIM.
Magento doesn’t allow you to have versioned product data. In most cases this is not a problem, because you want to sell based on the latest information and you have a reliable content management team. But what if this is not the case, you have computer illiterate shop assistants or old people trying to manage the site?</description>

      <description>We have a new pet at home – a Sphero. Kids love it but most of the programming tools are not for 5 years olds. With the help of old turtle logic and their recent experience playing with Bee-Bots in school we had some fun already. Keep your eyes open, BeeSphero is coming!
[Update 30/04/2014] Bee support didn’t react to my support request yet (Apple needs their approval too), I suppose they are busy developing the other bots…</description>

      <description>This is the time of the year when I do my little stock-taking around my memories about last year.
Mate had a good start in the school with the exception of some innocent violence pushing and kicking others. He has a good grasp of reading, he is using this newly acquired skill with confidence. The school turned out as an excellent choice.
Daniel failed to get good GCSE grades, but we have found a course at East Surrey College for him where he seems to be happy.</description>

      <title>Cache warmup based on sitemap</title>

      <description>I work with multiple sites without cache warmup technology. So I created one.
Don’t be mislead, it’s simple.
Basic usage:
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; $ ./warmup.rb www.someurl.tld&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
It will
 download http://www.someurl.tld/sitemap.xml parse that sitemap for urls run through that list of urls, downloading every HTML to warmup the cache  For further information and the code check up the Github repository</description>

      <description>As I’m working on Facebook share – there will be a share button under the recipe viewer screen that creates a Facebook note from the recipe – I had to create a Facebook page so I can link to it from every post.
Please like and check iRecipebook app Facebook page, I will update TODOs, fresh screenshots, recipes and my copy-paste resource links there.</description>

      <description>As Apple is pushing Storyboard based app development I’ve decided to give it a go. Having a family holiday with lots of spare time after the pools closed I’ve started to pull it together for iRecipeBook.
I had to find out how to simplify and standardise my old – I mean really old – code that I call guano code, created layer-by-layer as technology changed and requests came. Mostly it was about delegates, callbacks and properties – duplicated here and there, non-standard solutions for supporting of older (iOS 4.</description>

      <description>As of today, we still have 4.x systems running, iOS 5 is still not real minority, so I can’t just use iOS 6 API.
After reading several articles and trying every framework and sample code I could find my verdict is the same, iOS is not ready for Core Data iCloud yet. The currently available iOS versions are not behaving the same way so either it’s a testing nightmare or just a nightmare, developers can choose.</description>

      <description>I had some time to focus on localisation. As 4.3 and 5.0 version is still majority so I can’t really put iCloud features in use, I did something instead for non-English speakers. I hope every translation is correct. If not, please let me know.</description>

      <description>Finally I’ve released my block-building game for the kids! They’ve been testing it on the iPad for ages, asking for more faces, telling me that they like this, don’t like that etc.
Of course for App Store screen-shots I had to modify the UI, for loading and saving block layouts, it’s hard to create the same screen-shots for all the resolutions… and left a broken callback in the code even after testing, so 1.</description>

      <description>Toddlers’ Blocks is a 2D block building game for toddlers and older kids up to 99 years old. No violence – except of clashing blocks and downfalls – no need to learn how to play it but helps to build confidence with real world physics.
There is no real goal nor rules but to have fun.

      <description>This post is about last year.
I have to say it was really colourful. Lets begin with office matters. This was my second year at the company, we had good year so management decided to go to other markets too. This meant new language to support, having fun with French again, c’est bon. New colleagues, lots of learning. Good and bad decisions, really good and really bad days too.
At home we have helping hand (au pair) so my loved one Emese has a full time job again.</description>

      <description>We have a new release! The iPad compatible iRecipeBook was a request, actually we had a bad review, stating that the – iPhone only – iRecipeBook looks wrong on the iPad… The reviewer stated that five stars will be the award of an iPad compatible release. I’m waiting!
Meanwhile I’m already working on localisations, social networking update (Facebook share, Twitter, Pinterest maybe…) and sharing recipes via email and from within the App.</description>

      <description>It’s not common that you have to display something that’s not in the Magento database. It was not too difficult to figure out how to do it but checking this might save you few minutes.

      <description>I wanted to write a blogpost about MageHack 2012 London (magehack.com) but somehow failed until now. I’ll be brief as it was long ago and the memory is fading fast.
There was a pub warm-up event on the Friday before the event, with beers and schnitzel (a guy grabbed the last one just before me), sausages, mash… we’ve discussed our plans, trying to find out who will be possible project owner, who will join, and basically who’s who.</description>

      <description>It took terribly long to fix the built-in web server. Thank you for your support by using the App and sorry for annoyances. The focus is on social networking features now.
As the database is bigger and bigger, especially after uploading images for every recipe I’ve realized maybe we will have to implement an option to get rid of big images. The big image feature was introduced to help social networking publication, but clearly we can’t sacrifice launch performance.</description>

      <description>Our small team is publishing programs for the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch market from inner drive. When we need a program, we code it and release it. When we need an update, we update it. Sometimes we have time to do updates by request, sometimes not. Sorry for the later, it’s not because you are not important, but because we have less resources.
Update: 26/11/2015: Sorry but all apps have been discontinued. &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;wp-caption-text&amp;quot;&amp;gt; iWordsmith game &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;attachment_384&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;width: 117px&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;wp-caption aligncenter&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://wizguild.</description>

      <description>Five or More is an addictive game, helps you to spend as much time as you can, also good for training concentration or pointing accuracy. The game’s objective is to align five or more balls of the same color causing them to disappear, as often as possible. This is the iPhone port of the game GLines, also known as Five Or More from Gnome Project.
As an early pilot project please do not blame me for the awkwardness.</description>

      <description>Looking back on the year, as usual. My memory is so bad I have to take notes 🙂
If last year was positive, it’s even better, in every aspects.
I have a nice new job in a small international company as Head of IT / Architect, some kind of a CTO but with lots of fun around the code. We have few Magento systems, building new sites regularly, working with logistics companies and other partners connecting our systems to their, providing them data, sending and updating orders etc.</description>

      <description>Tough DSLRs are not for those who cannot make a steady shot with a pocket cam I decided to buy a D40 after recognising that my pictures are full of noise.
The challenge: to learn to shoot nice photos. I’ve read tutorials, books about the subject, I know the basics, the theory, but this is different.</description>

      <description>Hurray, hurray and hurray. My little game is in the App Store! It took long, but it’s there. You can download it for free of course, search for “Shooby”. I hope you will find it as annoying and fun as I do.
Update: I have been reviewed by “whoneedsaname”. It’s fascinating how the guy writes!</description>

      <description>Five Or More game screenshot
I’m still waiting Apple’s approval of my request to join their developer community. It’s not straightforward, because I cannot buy anything from Apple Store. I live on the wrong side of the world. I had to fax them papers to prove I will buy the subscription, now they are sitting on this paper and ask me to wait.
It’s not so easy to wait, after waiting more than one year to release something it’s more than annoying.</description>

      <description>I can’t wait the stable release! After years of watching the splash screen I was delighted to see how fast is the new OOo beta. Service guys has a big XLS price-list of the service parts, this beta software opened this huge file with such an easiness and speed… I will like the native OOo, I think. NeoOffice is still better if you have to edit something, I had many problems with the fonts and chart sizes, this is normal for a beta software.</description>

      <description>This morning I have finished porting iLines to official SDK. Works well. I have to admit there are drawbacks (lack of Interface Builder, coming soon) but my code was also buggy (I’m not surprised :))
So now I know I’ll be able to write software and probably I’ll do it. Before this Apple will have to release firmware 2.0 and this is the hardest thing to wait for something you can use now (theoretically).</description>

      <description>The new cat gives me so much, I can’t count everything.
After a clean install I have moved my programs into the Applications folder, then Application Support, Preferences and many things from my old home folder. After this I had a clean leo with my apps working (or not :))
I had to squash some bugs, too, for example FileMaker works with US locale but nothing else, hot-keys stopped working with international keyboard layouts (for example command-`, move focus to next window) this is really painful.</description>

      <description>It’s not official, barely legal (it’s from an Adium theme) but looks good. To install: get it here and after uncompressing copy it into /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/Resources/ChatStyles/ (or find the according folder on Linux and Windows). You cannot switch the color scheme and can’t show avatars, but it’s cute.</description>

      <description>After 2 months of fighting with my pain and inflammation in my lung with aid of drugs like steroids and antibiotics I had to find that after I stopped to get those pills the pain and the inflammation came back.
But it’s better than poisoning myself with steroids and drugs for blood pressure and so… after one month of taking Medrol I had terrible headache (I mean terrible and way too long… 3 weeks long without a minute stop) but it was better after I was able to stop taking it.</description>

I have no problem with my bones or muscles (the water is good for disabled people) but we had an invitation for 3 days.
The weather was so warm I walked on the street in t-shirt.</description>

I’m sitting in front of my machine, after a long trip. We had a meeting in Nyiregyhaza with the others and some pizza then in a 5 cars long convoy we started to annoy the border guards 🙂 It was a dumb situation when the Ukrainian border guard asked us (of course in Ukrainian language) about why we are waiting in a forbidden area.</description>

      <description>So, after hard times I have another chance to express my ideas and feelings about my environment. I’ve got new server! Wow, wow!
I’m so happy!
Few words about last months:
 I’m working at A4 Apple Center as Head of development, we are making financial systems for clients with Mac systems. I’m quite happy with my squash play. I had to make myself move somehow. Unfortunately BMP has moved back to Bicske so I haven’t got permanent partner.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I have bought a Nokia 6111. This is a good-looking Series 40 phone (sigh, no more python/c++ hacking, no more iSync)…
While there is a program to sync contacts, etc (works well with 6111) called PhoneDirector from MacMedia, I had to write my own (and free) app to upload the contents of my Address Book to the phone.
Gnokii is a good choice, if you have just one contact to sync but if you have few hundred you will have to make a script.</description>

      <description>New, faster, with fewer Java based bugs. Cool! I have to say Patric is working hard and making fantastic things around NeoOffice/J. Thanks, and please keep this process. Feel free to download the performance patch, it applies to 1.1 (downloadable from neooffice.org)…</description>

      <description>Yesterday I brought home the first Mighty mouse for testing. I have to say I was right. This is an evolutionary mouse, but users will have to learn to use it. Clicking with the right, left or the middle (OK, its better to say 1,2,3 or primary etc.) button is easy if you don’t think just do it. But when you see what you do (for example I lift my other fingers up) you will try to do it other ways and it does not work like that.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow I will start another “big project” and I still have lots of unfinished stuff here. I will have to make agreements with my previous clients who are complaining for support (unfortunately all of them think it’s free, gratis, etc…)
Normally I help them as I should, but after a number of requests I start to slow down, losing interest. I know it’s not the best what I can do, but they don’t want to pay my time and although I really like them (not all of them, but in general) I have to do my other jobs, too.</description>

      <description>Hard times, again. Hard to find time to stop, I feel something is missing. Maybe some holiday. While checking our schedule, we decided to have a break at next week. This is our last hope. I could just hope this will be OK for my clients and for Emese’s boss.
The plan is to camp out somewhere near, for example the Aquapark near Mogyorod… hmm… sounds relaxing. Although I need some rest, the weather forecasts and state of my projects make me feel bad about the next week… we will see.</description>

      <description>This weekend I had to figure out how the hack will I make the Mac OS X clients authenticate from Solaris 10 and Mac OS X server.
Netinfo is better, it’s easy to make it work on Mac OS X, but hard to compile on Solaris. I have to configure NIS on the Sun and test if it works.</description>

õ and û character problem I have made a FAQ page. I describe how to solve the problem when Word and NeoOffice does not see the õ and û characters in a document comes from Windows. It’s basically a problem specific documentation for FontBook, Apple’s most important but not-so-well-known application.

      <description>I’m happy with my new iMac G5, it’s fast, beautiful… but. I cannot install
(without hacking) YDL on it, because YDL 4.0 installer does not recognise
its combo drive. Is this serious? 🙁 I will check it again soon but I have
no time for hacking a new install set… I will have to find another ppc
distro.

avoid installing third party programs and system extensions. I could just
hope my backup was complete 🙂
After the reinstall I had 35 gigs of space, holy hard drive! OK, OK. After
installing the most necessary programs and my backup data I have just 20
gigs of 40, but it’s kind of interesting how many rubbish I used to store.</description>

script to help me making custom AFP shares. How to use it (from Terminal):
$ mkafpshare.sh sharename /path/of/directory/to/share
You will have to type in an administrator password (script uses sudo), then
turn off and on Personal File Sharing in System Preferences/Sharing.
When you are connecting to your mac from another mac, choose guest, and
voilà, new share 🙂</description>

      <description>The European Parliament will have a vote on the issue in September about
software patents. We are in the works to make that little difference by
putting pressure on the Hungarian government to withdraw their support for
the current draft.
We plan a demonstration and talks. Our last – and only – chance to influence
the decision to be made seems to be to put some pressure on the officials</description>

      <description>I have been using cvs for ages. Jul is subversion fan, I wanted to try it out,
so I had to install it.
Every time I said “fink install svn” or “fink install svn-client-ssl” I got
frightened from 40 new packages (apache2 and others) so I had to find
something.
So I had to recognise I was blind… on subversion’s official site there is a
link to an easy installing dmg… shame on me, again 🙂</description>

      <description>We’ve been planning to renovate the kid’s room for long time. On Sunday we
have started to remove the old wallpaper, move the furniture to other room,
etc.
Now we have a new wallpaper, and some time. Wallpaper have to dry, then we
will paint it and build the new furniture… hard days.</description>

      <description>There is a new version of English-Hungarian (Angol-Magyar) dictionary at

Good job, iJoe!</description>

I’ve seen some nice people out there. They were a bit foggy, I think they will
have to look for some way to force set the focus…
On Thursday hopefully I will check them IRL.</description>

(European Organization for Nuclear Research, read Nuclear part as inner
particles of atoms, protons and electrons not as nuclear technology).
I have been invited by Interware Rt. (a five stars server hosting hotel)
with many young (and not so very young) IT professionals and Interware’s
most important business partners.
For Your Information: The visit in CERN is for FREE.</description>

it’s a German version. We are fighting with the game. I mean I’m fighting with the
German language menus, I have “difficulties” with German. So I will try to
find the way to exchange it to an English version. The game is fantastic, but the
new combat mechanism (aktivemodus, brrr) is too fast for me. I like to</description>

Jul, Szimszon, Bmp, Kecsi and me.
What is Towel Day?
Towel Day has been declared by an internet movement to celebrate Douglas
Adams’ memory, it is set for 25th May. The idea was that people carry
their towel with them everywhere on that day as a tribute to Doulgas Adams.
So carry your towel with you throughout the day, think about Hitchhikers</description>

      <description>Gnome 2.6 is out! I feel shame, I had no commits since the last release. I
will have to check GKB and Glines if they were working… It’s hard to use a
PC…
I have found the missing key tab file for my ill-fated gkeycaps program, I
will try to continue the coding… I have forgot to commit it into the Gnome
CVS and the program does not work without this file 😛</description>

folding project, called Folding@Home.
The goal of the project is understand how to fold proteins and protein
aggregation, helping to fight Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, Mad Cow
(BSE), CJD and ALS… I love to help, so I have downloaded the GUI and the
screensaver and joined to Team Mac OS X.</description>

      <description>Yes, I have found the way of doing an OpenOffice.org package, with
just-mount-and-drag-and-drop install. I have still difficulties with the
user directory and the X11 presence, but I will solve it. I had promising meeting with the HDSys (the Hungarian apple distributor), after testing and bugfixes they will probably bundle it for Central European languages.
I have the Hungarian version already working on my desktop 🙂
My next project is to make a Hungarian, tested version of NeoOffice/J, but</description>

And old iMac (base G4 with some extra ram) versus an AMD 2GHz monster. Uh.
This will be a hard fight. We will try to introduce Macintosh for the
public. Fix.tv is a small tv

setting it up in changing network environment (I have to reedit /etc/hosts
every time I got new IP address) but runs well on my little book. I had to
make an oracle user, with sudo rights… The tomcat setup has changed
between jaguar and panther, so I had to edit some scripts (allup.sh and

to use his Mac server from a modem connection. After a sort search I found
mgetty has been ported to Mac OS X. The link is here:

I had to change Makefile a bit (there is no fax and modem user or group), I
bet nobody will be enough.
On panther I had to remove an “extern int sys_nerr;” from the logfile.</description>

      <description>After some calculations I’ve decided to buy new battery for my Powerbook here.
I will have problems with warranty but the price was cheaper (around 35
Euros). It’s hard to find an Apple shop!
I checked apple.fr for the list of resellers, then I met with different
shops:
We’ve had some problem with France Telecom (their phone boxes are not properly
working every time) but Sebastien solved the problem.
So I managed to buy the battery so now I’m happy but I have to wait for Emese</description>

This is the first time Maji will join to us, he will be a bit unhappy with the other people speaking foreign languages and no Hungarian. He can understand some basic words and expressions like “Yes”, “No”, “OK”, “Let’s go” in English but nothing in French.
We will show him the city, I’m sure he will enjoy the trip.</description>

LOTR3. I enjoyed it, the film had outstanding visual effects – except the
hobbits… The bluebox stuff was lame and badly lighted. The storyline was
well made, not much quake-like bloodbath… I think the giant spider was a
bit too scarry. The end was long, but they left out the last boring events
from the book, so it was a bit hollywood-kind end (family, kids, happy wife</description>

I saw his G5 (A clip from HAndras)
He managed to sell his “old” 1.6 GHz model and to buy a new one, a freaking
dual 2GHz G5. While the old one is waiting for the new owner HAndras was so
kind he gave it to me to compile the OpenOffice.org.
I am so happy!</description>
